The challenge was to create a portfolio utilising everything I had learnt over the first two modules of the course. 
This project will then form the foundation for my final portfolio showcasing my work. Essentially this is a bit of a first draft!

Part 1: Research
Coming from a design background, research is an integral part of any creative process.  


Part 2: Creating Portfolio wireframe in Figma
Used Abobe XD previously to wireframe 

Interactive prototype


Part 3: The Build 
I initially started building at desktop view, as I felt that it would be good to lay out the most complex structures within the design. However it did mean that I had to revist and retrace my steps to ensure that ....
responsive at each screen width.
Lesson learnt here to approach projects from a mobile first approach as research shows that ....

- At mobile view I did want to change my nav to become a burger menu - but again researched into it looked like JS would be needed here and wasn't sure of the best approach.
