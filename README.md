#### Figma Wireframe [_here_](https://www.figma.com/file/ovMIiLiBaMPCwlsSqC0zO1/VERSION-2?node-id=0%3A1)

## Approach:

- Initial portfolio site built using HTML & SCSS.
- Created wireframes and an interactive prototype in Figma.
- Created unique brand logos in Adobe Illustrator. 
- Responsive layout, built using a mobile first approach. Experimented with layout for the project section.

## Further Developments:

- As this portfolio project was one of the first things that I built on the course (during module 2) I would like to rebuild this site using React, creating more re-usable components and making the site more dynamic and interactive.
